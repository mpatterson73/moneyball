# Moneyball

The purpose of this project is to build a team of nine players (one at each position) with the most value based on [On Base Percentage (OBP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-base_percentage) and salary.

This was the method used by the Oakland A's to build a championship calliber team on a shostring budget. The story was chronicled the book "[Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1301.Moneyball)" and immortalized in the motion picture "[Moneyball](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1210166/)" starring Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill.

To accomplish this we will need each players [OBP](http://m.mlb.com/glossary/standard-stats/on-base-percentage)
 and salary for each season played.
